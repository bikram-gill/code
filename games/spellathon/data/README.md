A collection of useful code snippets and data files related to understanding and solving Spellathon.

## sources
The code in spellathon directory works on txt files, with word lists containing a word in each line. The file should be named 'words.txt', and placed in this directory. Following are some word-list repositories which can be used for working with the code:<br>

1. https://github.com/dwyl/english-words <br>
2. https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english <br>
3. http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jlawler/wordlist.html <br><br>

Another option is to use python inbuild words package 'pip install english-words', but different functions work on txt file and inbuilt package.<br>
